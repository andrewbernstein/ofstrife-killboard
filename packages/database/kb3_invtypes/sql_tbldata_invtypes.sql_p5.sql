When integrated into armor plating in larger amounts, they also risked turning the vessel into a giant warhead, something even less desirable. \r\n\r\nA solution was finally found. Tiny amounts of metallofullerenes would be integrated in conjunction with far larger quantities of graphene nanoribbons and then coated in powdered C-540 graphite. This process allowed the material to maintain structural durability whilst keeping mass down. The last and most ingenious addition was to incorporate fulleroferrocene into the metal beneath layers of electromechanical hull sheeting. This had the effect of turning the normally dangerous explosive reactions into kinetic energy, which could then be used to supplement the power supply to local nanoassemblers.', '76_11', '1', '5', '0', '1', '0', '400000', '1147'),

('30470', '964', 'Neurovisual Output Analyzer', 'As a capsuleer, few things are more important in space-flight than the ability to instantly gauge one''s surroundings and make decisions accordingly. For this reason, capsules inside starships make frequent use of neurovisual reproductions; emulations that recreate external stimuli using the most low-latency processor available: the human brain. This process relies on digital relays from camera drones and monitoring systems embedded into the hull. After the data is captured, it is then relayed directly into the brain, at which point the external surrounds are recreated almost instantaneously.\r\n\r\nThe synthetic translation of external stimuli into neurovisual imagery is incredibly risky, even relative to the standard hazards of pod piloting. Even though capsuleers have an innate resistance to neurobiological damage from these sorts of processes, the near- constant exposure to them has been linked to increased risk of aggressive neurodegenerative diseases. In recent years, engineers have begun to integrate neurovisual output analyzers into a starship''s electronics systems.

Catalysts are their preferred escort craft, combining high speed and maneuverability with an extremely heavy punch. For its highest-value runs, IZS prefers to use brand-new hulls, which are then immediately sold off after use to prevent unscrupulous elements from tracking their ID numbers. While most of these ships are repainted and sold as stock, Inner Zone has discovered a lucrative sideline in selling a few on to capsuleer collectors, who place a premium on ships with interesting histories.', '', '1550000', '55000', '450', '1', '8', '2', '1613'),
