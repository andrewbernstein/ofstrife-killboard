Project Theta aims to achieve this goal by repurposing and reverse engineering available rogue drone technology to create a communications subnet intended to interface with the more advanced rogue drone networks.\r\n\r\nThe three-unit communications system includes an override of the present comms systems, designed as a protective measure. It has also been designed to provide on-the-fly encoding and decoding. Future testing will be necessary to determine if the system will work as required.\r\n\r\nBased on the <a href=showinfo:23678>Aether Hive Link</a> the network remains experimental, and will be part of an isolated communications system. Recent lab tests have indicated a bandwidth of at least ten times that which is available to typical businesses.\r\n\r\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the <a href=evebrowser: http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Arek%27Jaalan>Arek''Jaalan Project.</a></i>\r\n\r\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek''Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>', '50_11', '1', '0.1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0'),

Entire systems are attacked and disabled, but he reserves his most massive, propagandist attacks for the Slaves and Citizens, who come in <a href=showinfo:3628>Nation</a>-class supercapitals to destroy the capsuleer fleets. The hallmarks of these invasions are multiple wormholes under the direct control of Sansha''s Nation.

The rogue drone hive found at the Skeleton Comet complex within the <a href=showinfo:5//30002681>Deltole</a> system appears to have assimilated ancient technologies left behind by the Yan Jung nation, resulting in the development of a new strain of drones, potentially more powerful than their standard counterparts. \r\n\r\nTwo reports on these events were gathered to determine the extent to which the drones were affected by assimilating the Yan Jung technology, and to establish what level of threat this could pose. The findings showed that the new strain of drones possess significantly enhanced communication systems and cognitive abilities as compared with their predecessors. However, through the examination process it was also discovered that apparently, nearly all of the new drone strains had been destroyed by the original rogue drone hive, likely due to self-regulatory mechanisms within the hive.

The project is primarily aimed at identifying stellar objects – both in New Eden and in wormhole space – through spectroscopic analysis, and by using the properties of parallax and triangulation to determine the location of wormhole space in relation to New Eden. The Lead Researcher surveyed a random sample of wormhole systems and was able to identify a star cluster identifiable in both New Eden and wormhole space. Through mathematical extrapolation and analysis, the location of wormhole space was determined.\r\n\r\nProject Compass draws no final conclusions at this stage, as researchers are awaiting potential changes to capsule sensor technology that may yield new data.\r\n\r\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the <a href=evebrowser: http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Arek%27Jaalan>Arek''Jaalan Project.</a></i>\r\n\r\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek''Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>', '50_11', '1', '0.1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0'),

This brings up the question of how life originally came to planets in Anoikis.\r\n\r\nThe “molecular clock” method was used to estimate how long ago life in Anoikis and life in known space had a common ancestor. In the molecular clock method random changes to segments of “junk” DNA are examined and compared between organisms. Changes in these segments occur randomly, accumulate over time, and are not selected for by evolution. By seeing how different a given segment of junk DNA is between two organisms, an estimate can be made as to how long ago they had a common ancestor. \r\n\r\nFor this case, microorganisms that live in known space and those that live in Anoikis were compared. \r\n\r\nIt was found that life in Anoikis split from life in known space during the dark ages, the time period between the closure of the eve gate and the rebirth of civilization. Apparently, during this time, some space-faring civilization survived, or arose much faster than has been assumed. This civilization appears to have moved to Anoikis and made use of the planets.\r\n\r\nSome organisms were found that had a common ancestor with life in known space about a year ago. This is likely contamination from recent capsuleer activity in Anoikis.\r\n\r\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the <a href=evebrowser: http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Arek%27Jaalan>Arek''Jaalan Project.</a></i>\r\n\r\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek''Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>', '50_11', '1', '0.1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0');

('4338', '1141', 'Arek''Jaalan: Mission Statement', 'The Arek''Jaalan Project was founded to act as a cross-organizational research body and common ground for capsuleers to share information about the Sleeper civilization and related matters. The goals of the project are, relative to similar bodies, both simple to understand and quite humble. Put simply, our aim is to research, document and educate.\r\n\r\n<font color="blue">Research:</font> We aim to posit and debate theories, study known facts and uncover new ones, and use every other method available to deepen our understanding of the Sleepers and related subjects.\r\n\r\n<font color="blue">Document:</font> Through extensive use of open networks, and with the help of key staff, we aim to document all of the information shared between project members, from everyday communication to large-scale research projects.\r\n\r\n<font color="blue">Educate:</font> Using our body of contributors and their documented research as a foundation, we aim to educate other capsuleers about our work, and to encourage wider capsuleer interest in scientific matters by presenting information openly and accessibly.\r\n\r\nIn its initial phase, the project aims to build a “foundational” body of documented research, at which point a larger focus will begin to be placed on the goal of education.\r\n\r\nIt should be emphasized that Arek''Jaalan does not aim to produce new technologies, and in particular that we take an active stance against any further weaponization of Sleeper or other technologies. We aim for something more benign and progressive.\r\n\r\nIt should be similarly noted that much of our work lies in centralizing and documenting scattered, yet publicly available, information. In the absence of these hard facts, we turn to educated theory. Although there is always the risk of information being used for immoral ends, it should be remembered what the majority of our work at the Arek''Jaalan project actually amounts to, and that our own stance is to be firmly against such actions.\r\n\r\nOverwhelmingly, the current focus of interest in capsuleer research is applied science, particularly weaponization. The work we do is intended to help humanity, and science as a whole, not just the capsuleer military-industrial cycle. Arek''Jaalan stands apart from the destructive mainstream; as an alternative way for capsuleers to use their unique capabilities. ', '50_11', '1', '0.1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0'),
