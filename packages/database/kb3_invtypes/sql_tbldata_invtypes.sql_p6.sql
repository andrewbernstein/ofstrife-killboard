Targets are ‘painted’ with a high intensity beam that deals sustained, focused damage in a concentrated area to maximize damage potential. At the core of the weapon is the thermal cavity, within which an optic spacer converges and blends three individually pumped beams into a single coherent output. The additional distortion introduced by each beam results in weakened output at close range, but as the weapon warms up to mean operating temperature the wavelength stabilizes and the damage output increases significantly, producing a weapon of unmatched precision and lethality in mid-range combat.\r\nHeat build-up is typically managed by a self-regulating failsafe, a device used to forcibly shut the weapon off at regular intervals, flushing heat from its internal workings and preventing lethal feedback to the user, but most laser rifles in the field have been altered to bypass the built-in safety protocols.', 'res:/', '0', '0.01', '0', '1', '0', '6000', '354690'),

Beyond that, the device also makes use of an advanced K7 nano static co-processor on par with Caldari planet side missile tracking systems and a 55x5 reverse current power cell configuration rarely used beyond self-sustaining Gallente drone units.
